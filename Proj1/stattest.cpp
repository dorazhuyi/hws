void print_menu( );
// Postcondition: A menu of choices for this program has been written to cout.
// Library facilties used: iostream.h

char get_user_command( );
// Postcondition: The user has been prompted to enter a one character command.
// A line of input (with at least one character) has been read, and the first
// character of the input line is returned.

// Postcondition: The user has been prompted to enter a real number. The
// number has been read, echoed to the screen, and returned by the function.

// Postcondition: The length, sum, minimum, mean, and maximum of s have been
// written to cout, using a field width of 10 for each of these values.
// (If length is zero, then minimum, mean, and maximum are not written.)
